# Shyffon Homepage & CRUD Example
NSY PHP Framework Example with HTML5 Boilerplate and Foundation CSS Framework. This also provides Font-Awesome and several optimizations for Datatables plugin.

This is an example of a `CRUD` program & homepage using the NSY Framework ([Shyffon Project](https://github.com/kazuyamarino/shyffon)), i hope it can be useful for everyone to start using NSY as the project framework. I made this because I know that everyone loves `CRUD`..so Enjoy it!

Site example :
[https://shyffon.kazuyamarino.com](https://shyffon.kazuyamarino.com)

## Lets start!
* Simply rename the folder that has been downloaded to `shyffon` & copy it to your `html` or `htdocs` or anythings folder.
* For apache, please go to the `docs/apache` folder and read the Readme.txt.
* For nginx, please go to the `docs/nginx` folder.
* Go to the `docs/env` folder and copy the `.env.example` to root folder, and rename it to `.env`.
* Import database example. (see below)
* And save the date..

## Database Example
There is an example database (sql file) in the `docs/db_example/` folder.

## Shyffon contain package :
* [Datatables jQuery Javascript Library](https://www.datatables.net/) with Responsive Plugin
* [Foundation Zurb Framework](https://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
* [WhatInputJs](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input)
* [Font Awesome CDN](https://fontawesome.com/)

## Browser support test
NSY is made with Foundation CSS Framework. This information is based on [Foundation Compatibility](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/compatibility.html).

>Foundation is tested across many browsers and devices, and works back as far as IE9 and Android 2.

## Overview
<table class="docs-compat-table">
  <tr>
    <td>Chrome</td>
    <td class="works" rowspan="7">Last Two Versions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Firefox</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Safari</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Opera</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mobile Safari<sup>1</sup></td></tr>
  <tr><td>IE Mobile</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Edge</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Internet Explorer</td>
    <td class="works">Versions 9+</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Android Browser</td>
    <td class="works">Versions 4.4+</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>1</sup>iOS 7+ is actively supported but with some known bugs.

## What Won't Work?
* **The Grid:** Foundation's grid uses `box-sizing: border-box` to apply gutters to columns, but this property isn't supported in IE8.
* **Desktop Styles:** Because the framework is written mobile-first, browsers that don't support media queries will display the mobile styles of the site.
* **JavaScript:** Our plugins use a number of handy ECMAScript 5 features that aren't supported in IE8.

*This doesn't mean that NSY cannot be used in older browsers,
just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.*
